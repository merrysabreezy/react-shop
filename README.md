# React Shop Product Viewer

This project is a React application built with TypeScript that displays a list of products and detailed product information fetched from the live API at [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com/products). The project demonstrates how to integrate a live API, implement routing, and use TypeScript for type safety.

## Project Overview

- **Product List:** Displays a list of products fetched from the dummyjson API.
- **Product Details:** Shows detailed information for a selected product.
- **Layout:** The app uses a two-pane design:
  - **Left Side:** Displays product details (or a placeholder message if no product is selected).
  - **Right Side:** Shows the product list.
- **Routing:** Uses `react-router-dom` (v6) for navigation.
- **Styling:** Basic CSS is included. Feel free to adjust or add styles to enhance the layout and responsiveness.
  - The application should be **Mobile Responsive**

## Live API Integration

The project uses live API endpoints from dummyjson.com:

- **Fetch All Products:** `https://dummyjson.com/products`
- **Fetch Product by ID:** `https://dummyjson.com/products/{id}`
